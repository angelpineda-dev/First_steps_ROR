# README

This app follows the first steps with Ruby on Rails from [getting started guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) official documentation to understand the principles of Ruby on Rails framework.

There is also posible find nonsense things related with the docs but useful to me to practice with other tools, once I have enough knowledge of this framework I'll build a structured app.
